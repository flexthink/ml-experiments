# Machine Learning Experiments

A collection of quick-and-dirty machine learning-related experiments, primarily created for the purpose of exploring various aspects of machine learning and AI.

- **GeoLearnV3.ipynb**: An attempt to use a convolutional neural network to distinguish between geometric shapes and localize them precisely in an image (similar to semantic segmentation). The motivation for this is to select a neural network architecture that would be able to simultaneously classify and localize specific features. Originally, it was created in response to some difficulties encountered in a more difficult experiment (i.e. localizing a user's finger within a camera image)
